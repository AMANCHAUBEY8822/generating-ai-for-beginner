Generative AI for Beginners (Version 2) - A Course
Learn the fundamentals of building Generative AI applications with our 18-lesson comprehensive course by Microsoft Cloud Advocates.

üå± Getting Started
This course has 18 lessons. Each lesson covers its own topic so start wherever you like!

Lessons are labeled either "Learn" lessons explaining a Generative AI concept or "Build" lessons that explain a concept and code examples in both Python and TypeScript when possible.

Each lesson also includes a "Keep Learning" section with additional learning tools.

What You Need

Access to the Azure OpenAI Service OR OpenAI API OR GitHub Marketplace Model Catalog - Only required to complete coding lessons
Basic knowledge of Python or TypeScript is helpful - *For absolute beginners check out these Python and TypeScript courses.
A GitHub account to fork this entire repo to your own GitHub account
We have created a Course Setup lesson to help you with setting up your development environment.

Don't forget to star (üåü) this repo to find it easier later.

üß† Ready to Deploy?
If you are looking for more advanced code samples, check out our collection of Generative AI Code Samples in both Python and TypeScript.
